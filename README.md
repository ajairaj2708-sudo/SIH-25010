## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.Here are some images that visually represent the challenges described in your problem statement — including traditional farming practices, lack of access to agri-tech tools, and digital illiteracy among small and marginal farmers in India.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solutionhttp:
- Soil & Crop Intelligence
- AI-based recommendations for crop selection based on soil type, weather, and crop history.
- Integration with soil testing labs and satellite data for precision insights.
- Pest & Disease Alerts
- Real-time pest and disease detection using image recognition and farmer-uploaded photos.
- Region-specific alerts and preventive measures.
- Fertilizer & Input Optimization
- Tailored fertilizer schedules to reduce chemical overuse and cut costs.
- Organic alternatives and sustainable practices promoted.
- Multilingual Voice Assistant
- Conversational interface in local languages (e.g., Tamil, Hindi, Telugu) for low-literacy users.
- Voice-based queries and responses to bypass text barriers.
- Offline Functionality
- Core features accessible without internet; syncs when online.
- SMS-based advisory for feature phone users.
- Farmer Community & Marketplace
- Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and success stories.
- Direct access to verified input suppliers and buyers.
- Pilot in High-Need Districts: Start with regions like Vidarbha, Bundelkhand, or delta areas of Tamil Nadu.
- Partnerships: Collaborate with agri universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and NGOs.

## Technical Approach. Data Collection & Integration Layer
- Soil Data: Integrate with government soil health databases and enable farmers to upload soil test reports.
- Weather Data: Use APIs from IMD or private providers for hyperlocal weather forecasts.
- Crop History: Maintain farmer-specific crop logs via mobile app or SMS input.
- Satellite & Drone Imagery: Optional integration for advanced monitoring of crop health and pest spread.
 AI-Powered Advisory Engine
- Crop Recommendation Model:
- Inputs: Soil type, weather forecast, crop history, market demand.
- Output: Best-fit crop suggestions with expected yield and ROI.
- Pest & Disease Diagnosis:
- Image recognition using CNN models trained on regional pest datasets.
- Text/voice-based symptom input for non-camera users.
- Fertilizer Optimization:
- ML models to suggest dosage and timing based on crop stage and soil nutrients.


## Feasibility and Viability
1. Market Viability
- Target Audience: Over 100 million small and marginal farmers in India.
- Demand Drivers:
- Rising input costs
- Climate unpredictability
- Growing awareness of sustainable farming

## Impact and Benefits
   1. Agricultural Productivity
- Improved Crop Yields: Personalized crop recommendations based on soil and weather data lead to better harvests.
- Reduced Crop Failure: Early pest/disease alerts and weather warnings help farmers take timely action.
- Optimized Input Use: Precision fertilizer and pesticide guidance reduces waste and enhances soil health.
   2. Economic Empowerment
- Lower Input Costs: Avoiding unnecessary chemical use and choosing cost-effective crops improves profitability.
- Better Market Access: Direct linkage to buyers and mandis increases bargaining power and income.
- Financial Inclusion: Integration with government schemes and digital payment options boosts access to subsidies and credit.
   3. Environmental Sustainability
- Reduced Chemical Runoff: Controlled use of fertilizers and pesticides protects water bodies and biodiversity.
- Soil Regeneration: Promotion of organic practices and crop rotation improves long-term soil fertility.
- Climate Resilience: Adaptive cropping strategies based on weather forecasts mitigate climate risks.

## Research and References
   1. Extent of the Problem
- 86% of Indian farmers are classified as small and marginal, owning less than 2 hectares of land.
- Despite their dominance, they only control 47% of agricultural land, limiting their ability to scale operations.
2. Access to Inputs & Advisory
- Only 35% of small farmers have access to high-quality seeds and fertilizers.
- Most rely on informal sources like local shopkeepers or traditional practices, which may not be scientifically sound.
3. Financial Vulnerability
- Over 60% of small farmers depend on informal credit sources, often facing interest rates as high as 36%, compared to institutional rates of 7%.
- This financial stress leads to suboptimal input choices and increased risk of debt cycles.
